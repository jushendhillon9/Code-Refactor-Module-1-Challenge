Description: In this module challenge, I refactored a given starter code for a reputation management site known as Horiseon. An issue with the navigation in the header of the website was resolved to improve its overall User Interface. Semantic elements were also implemented into the starter code, and minor issues regarding the project's name, alt attributes for images, and numbering of header elements were resolved. All CSS selectors and properties were properly organized.
